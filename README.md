A simple webpage of a map using the google maps API. Will default to the University
of Oregon and upon allowing google to access the client's location, will set the 
screen to their location with a marker. Also handles three additional markers in the
text file that each have a specific location and description that can be accessed
after the user clicks on it within the map.
